## Data Set Description

Our dataset was obtained from Kaggle, an online data science community with various open datasets to choose from. Our dataset is the “World Happiness Report” formed by the Sustainable Development Network. In the dataset, there are 10 columns: Year, Country, Happiness Rank (from 1-158), Happiness Score, GDP Per Capita, Family, Life Expectancy, Freedom, Government Corruption, and Generosity. Data types include integer and string types - the only string being the Country name. In total, there are 471 rows in the dataset, however, this is a combination of between 155-158 rows for each year from 2015-2017. The values for columns (aside from Happiness Score) are ratios between 0 and 1, with 1 being the best - or worst for government corruption - possible score.
