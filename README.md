## Data Set Description

Our dataset was obtained from Kaggle, an online data science community with various open datasets to choose from. Our dataset is the “World Happiness Report” formed by the Sustainable Development Network. In the dataset, there are 10 columns: Year, Country, Happiness Rank (from 1-158), Happiness Score, GDP Per Capita, Family, Life Expectancy, Freedom, Government Corruption, and Generosity. Data types include integer and string types - the only string being the Country name. In total, there are 471 rows in the dataset, however, this is a combination of between 155-158 rows for each year from 2015-2017. The values for columns (aside from Happiness Score) are ratios between 0 and 1, with 1 being the best - or worst for government corruption - possible score. 
 
## Our Questions and Why They are Interesting

1. Do average happiness and average life expectancy have a strong correlation to average GDP and what socioeconomic factors may influence this?

Reasons for Importance:

## Manipulations 

For our dataset, we firstly adjusted many of the column names to be more clear indicators of their values. For example, we changed the “Economy” column to “GDP Per Capita” because that is the true value being used. We also removed data from 2019 and 2020 because they use different variables, making it difficult to correctly analyze. For our first visualization, we created a filter to only include European countries on our scatterplot since they have the most variance in happiness levels (they have some of the happiest and least happy countries in our dataset). For our second visualization, we created a filter to only show Central and South American countries in order to focus in on distinctions within that particular region because there is a wide variety of social, political, and economic situations going on in those regions, and the heatmap allows us to narrow down our research into specific countries within said regions.
